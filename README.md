## react-spring-transitions

Readymade [react-spring](https://react-spring.io) transitions as higher-order components.

You probably should not use these, as they are somewhat trivial to implement just with plain CSS. I created this package mainly to see what it's like to publish something to NPM.

But thanks for checking this out, and have a nice day!
